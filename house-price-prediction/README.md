# House Price Prediction

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
This competition was about creating a regressor for House price prediction and trying different advanced regressor techniques.

## house_prediction.py

The house_prediction.py file contains all the data preprocessing part which includes data cleaning and handling of null values and data visualization.
And this file creates a housePred.pickle file to save the regressor which can be used later for Price Prediction

## test_pred.py

This file contains the program for testing the pickled regressor by house_prediction.py
